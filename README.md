# syllables
Uses letter patterns to guess the number of syllables in a word - real or not.
There are some exceptions that break it:
- ion, scion, etc
- peaceful & similar compound words and words with suffixes
- miscreant, create, etc (-ea- structure with 2 syllables is hard to detect)

TODO:
Try training a NN to guess these instead, compare proficiency
